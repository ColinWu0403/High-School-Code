# Old-High-School-Code
Projects that I did during high school
I learned a bit of PHP, JavaScript, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL.
### The PHP folder contains a few websites/webapps I have created with the XAMPP Apache Server
### Other folders like Python and C++ contain some example programs I have made
